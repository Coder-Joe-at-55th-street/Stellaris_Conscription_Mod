 mobilize.1.name:0 "Revival of Conscription System"
 mobilize.1.desc:0 "Three hundred years ago, our ancestor fought wars violently, throwing the life of a whole generation into the trenches as reluctant conscripts. We thought conscription is no longer possible in space age, but fortunately we are wrong. \nRecent studies have shown that mass conscription is still possible. With a bit help in nationalism propaganda, we can easily prepare thousands of mechanized and light infantry division by drafting our people. \nMoreover, experience from war showed that converted merchant marines and outdated cruisers are tougher than we initially anticipated. New means of organizations also made it possible to let civilians serve in less important positions on battleships. \nAs a result, we now can pick up the conscription system, and draft about §Y13%§! of our total population into our military. We have created the 'Wartime Administration Authority' to deal with conscription issue. \nNote that conscription is only possible in war, and you must let conscript go home as war ends. Also remember that, mobilizing a numerous army is same as exhausting the country’s future to fight a concurrent war, and such decisions shall only be enacted only when the nation has come to her darkest hours."

Police forces, both civillian and military, has been mobilized to deal with desertion with any means possible. \nConscription will work as the following, using a 2% draft as example. 2% refers to drafted citizen amongst our total population, thus in game 2% of population will vanish. Each population will contribute 200 million of troop, with 60 million serving in navy of 24 naval capacity, and 140 million serving in four assault and defense army, with 17.5 million people each. \n §RNote that, this population only contains people who are not ruling class, because they almost always have their own way to escape from conscriptions§!."
