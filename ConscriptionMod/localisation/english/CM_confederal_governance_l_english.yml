Devolution of overarching and #corrupt central bureaucracy to de-centralized autonomous zones brought an unforeseen era of prosperity and innovation, which quickly allowed people to unify #under the flag of Confederalism. \nWill this great experiment of self-rule and decentralization prevail, or will it be swallowed by oppressive authoritarian tyrants? #Only time shall tell."
